How will you continue learning about computer science?

I think that I have been able to develop more effective learning skills in regards to coding as a result of how the course was structure. It offered flexibility as well as forcing the student to think more critically and be able to learn concepts without the need of organized lessons. I think that is truly an important skill since it is inevitable you teach yourself more skills as you further progress in learning concepts in post secondary and even when you get the opportunity to enter the industry. Personally, I have intentions on following multiple UDemy courses such as creating more JS side projects, following plenty more CodeCademy courses since they are structured in an approachable sense and to potentially keep working on FreeCodeCamp. Since my Discord Bot was my first sense of building a side project on my own, I hope to keep developing stuff like that in the future to further justify that I understand the concepts. Furthermore, apart from independently learning concepts in my free time, I wish to pursue organized forms of learning in the sense that I will be joining a Robotics team in the near future and also intend on applying to tech-related jobs which can function as the guided outlet for learning in contrast to me doing everything by myself. I personally feel as the more commitment you put in, the more benefits you will received since I can easily admit to idealizing the benefit I got from putting so much work into this course and in my portfolio.


What should one take note of your portfolio?

I'd like to show my versatility with the portfolio. I have multiple coding and markdown languages apart from the mandatory ones such as Python, SQL and jQuery (a library is still new content), and how I also emphasize that you can link these concepts together to create a genuine project. For example, I explain how that with the help of the Khan Acadeny AND multiple FreeCodeCamp modules helped me learn how to develop a Discord Bot using custom syntax and Node JS. The tiny skills I picked up along the way was crucial in helping me problem solve and therefore demonstrate my learning. I also had a lot of issue of what to include in my portfolio since I realized I had too much information, so I did cut it down but not simply removing stuff, but integrating it to my other modules to give the sense that I learned more than what was expected. Examples of this include my Computer Science Principles module has other units included but not meant to be counted, and the various FCC modules I showed for completing but didn't really set a specific project to. The reasoning for doing so is the idea that I am prepared to take initiative to learn more concepts in order to fully demonstrate my capabilities as a programmer.
