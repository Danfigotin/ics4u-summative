  <h1>Preface</h1>
  <p>This is my ICS4U portfolio, where I organized everything I learned during the two and a half quadmester into a single website. To describe how this learning process went, I can confidently say that I have been able to develop better learning skills in regards to computing in the way we were given the course. To have the freedom to learn and process all the new content at your own pace while also being given the opportunity to learn other concepts has enabled me to learn much more than expected. It also gave me more tools on how to code outside of the classroom, making the newly-formed skills useful in adjacent to the class and to my personal enjoyment. I also was able to use the new skills I learned to create stuff that was useful to me in a way unrelated to the class. The reason why I consider these skills to be useful is because I have intentions on pursuing Computer Science after high school, so the more skills I can pick up will be useful to me. </p>
